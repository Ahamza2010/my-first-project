            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Education in Pakistan is overseen by the Federal Ministry of Education
                and the provincial governments, while the federal government mostly assists in curriculum development,
                accreditation and the financing of research and development. Article 25-A of the Constitution of
                Pakistan obligates the state to provide free and compulsory quality education to children of the age
                group 5 to 16 years. "The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age
                of five to sixteen years in such a manner as may be determined by law".[3] Considering the challenges
                confronting the youth in Pakistan, it's hardly astonishing that well-off and educated young individuals
                and professionals are opting to depart the country whenever they have the opportunity, exacerbating the
                brain drain phenomenon.[4]

                Pakistan still has a low literacy rate relative to other countries.[9] As of 2016 Pakistan's literacy
                rates range from 82% in Islamabad to 23% in the Torghar District.[10] Literacy rates vary by gender and
                region. In tribal areas female literacy is 9.5%,[11] while Azad Kashmir has a literacy rate of 74%.[12]
                Pakistan's population of children not in school (22.8 million children) is the second largest in the
                world after Nigeria.[13] According to the data, Pakistan faces a significant unemployment challenge,
                particularly among its educated youth, with over 31% of them being unemployed. Moreover, women account
                for 51% of the overall unemployed population, highlighting a gender disparity in employment
                opportunities.[14] Pakistan produces about 445,000 university graduates and 25,000 to 30,000 computer
                science graduates per year As of 2021.[15]</p>

            <p class="Heading">History of Pakistan and laws</p>
            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">The country of Pakistan is a profound patriarchal society. Throughout
                Pakistan's educational system, there is a gender disparity between males and females. In fact, according
                to the 2016 Global Gender Gap Report, Pakistan was ranked the second worst country in the world
                regarding gender inequality.[26]

                In Pakistan, gender discrimination in education occurs among the poorest households.[27] Only 18% of
                Pakistani women have received 10 years or more of schooling.[28][27] Among other criticisms the
                Pakistani education system faces is the gender disparity in enrollment levels. However, in recent years
                some progress has been made in trying to fix this problem. In 1990–91, the female to male ratio (F/M
                ratio) of enrollment was 0.47 for primary level of education.

                One example of this progress recently made in 2010 was that primary education is a legal right for
                children ranging from five to sixteen years old.[30] The gender disparity in enrollment at secondary
                level of education was 0.4 in 1990-91 and 0.67 in 1999–2000, showing that the disparity decreased by
                67.5% in the decade. At the college level, it was 0.50 in 1990–91 and reached 0.81 in 1999–2000, showing
                that the disparity decreased by 64%. The gender disparity has decreased comparatively rapidly at
                secondary school.[29]


                restricting women to 50% of available seats (based on the gender ratios in general population).[37][38]
                This quota was challenged and subsequently deemed unconstitutional (and discriminatory) by Lahore High
                Court.[39][40] Research indicates several problems faced by women doctors in Pakistan in their career
                and education, including lack of implementation of women-friendly policies.

                Abdus Salam was a Pakistani theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate in physics for his work on the
                electroweak unification of the electromagnetic and weak forces. Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven
                Weinberg shared the 1979 Nobel prize for this work. Salam holds the distinction of being the first
                Pakistani to receive the Nobel Prize in any field. Salam heavily contributed to the rise of Pakistani
                physics to the Physics community in the world.[57][58]

                citations and h index of 74.[59] He was elected as Fellow of the Royal Society (London) in 2006[60] and
                won the UNESCO Science Prize in 1999.[61] The revolutionary changes that he brought in the higher
                education as well as science and technology sectors won him numerous national and international awards,
                including the highest national award, Nishan-i-Imtiaz.[62] He also won the highest award for
                international collaboration of China.[63] He was also awarded a high civil award of the Government of
                Austria in recognition of his services to science[64][65]</p>

            <p class="Heading">Literacy rates and development </p>
            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Pakistan has one of the lowest literacy rates in South Asia at 49.9
                percent. The male literacy rate is 61.7 percent and the female literacy rate is 35.2 percent. The female
                literacy rate drops to twenty-five percent in rural areas of Pakistan. Girls' school enrollment also
                significantly drops in the rural areas of Pakistan. The enrollment rate for girls in rural areas is only
                twenty percent in grade school. Sixty-five percent of Pakistan's population is made up of rural
                citizens. Citizens in Pakistan face issues that affect their quality of life. Issues such as illiteracy
                are linked to poverty and lack of basic needs.[109]

                Parents with lower literacy skills struggle to understand health recommendations that can affect the
                development of their children. Malnutrition is a problem for children of parents who do not have a
                formal education status. Uneducated parents may not know the necessary proper nutrition needed for their
                children to adequately grow and develop. Malnutrition is associated with mothers who are illiterate and
                unaware of correct feeding practices.[110] There are several factors that contribute to the low
                education levels in Pakistan. Among the primary catalysts are unemployment, poverty, lack of awareness,
                teachers' absenteeism.[111]

                In a study published by the Research Journal of Commerce, Economics, and Social Sciences, discusses the
                importance of education. The study compares Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan. Education plays a huge
                role and is a crucial tool for overall improvement in well-being. Education helps jobs, upholds social
                justice and equity, social and self-awareness, and open mindedness. Education is one of the most
                important contribution a country can offer its citizens in the hopes of inequality and poverty.
                Education has a very positive effect on human life. In any society education plays such a basic role and
                without education we cannot imagine a life. This study found that there are many differences in culture
                in Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan as well as resources within the country are also very different. The
                data reveals that the literacy rate of Indonesia is 90%, Malaysia is 89% and Pakistan is 54.9%, which is
                significantly lower in compared to the other two countries. In comparison to these other two countries,
                Pakistan has the more poverty and inequality within its country. It only makes sense that it has the
                lowest literacy rate because of this. If Pakistan's literacy rates were to go up, their poverty and
                inequality within their country would hopefully go down, creating a better society and more beneficial
                country.[112]</p>
